A decentralized crowdfunding platform , where each campaign automatically generates its own unique token, creating a hybrid investment/donation model that gives backers both social impact and potential financial returns.

**Key Features**

**Campaign Launch & Token Creation**

- When creators launch a campaign, the smart contract automatically deploys a unique ERC-20 token for that specific project
- Token supply and distribution mechanics are set during campaign creation
- Creators define funding goals, timeline, and tokenomics parameters

**Dynamic Contribution Rewards**

- Backers receive campaign tokens proportional to their contribution amount
- Early backers get bonus token allocations or better exchange rates
- This creates incentives for early adoption and larger contributions
- Tokens represent both support for the cause and potential future value

**Flexible Campaign Resolution**
Creators can set specific conditions for fund withdrawal before launching a campaign. They can choose to allow withdrawals at the end regardless of the threshold or only after reaching a certain funding goal.
After campaign completion, creators have two strategic options:

1. **Traditional Withdrawal**: Extract raised funds for project execution (standard crowdfunding model)
2. **Token Launch**: Deploy the campaign token to DEX platforms like Uniswap, similar to how $MIRA transitioned from crowdfunded project to tradeable asset

Creators can choose to partition their token supply for different purposes.
